        A little about me...
      </h5>
      <p>
        As you can see, I have two last names, this is because in Mexico, the first last 
        name corresponds to first last name of the father, and the second last name corresponds the first last name of the mother. 
        (Javier Leal & Blanca Maldonado). The way I pronunciate in Spanish is different in English, but if I say it in Spanish, 
        people tend to confuse the letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        My family and I moved from Monterrey, Mexico to Seattle in Summer of 2018, and we like it very much. 
        I love the weather here, and all the people I've met is extremely nice.
